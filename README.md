WhoisSwitchX's Portfolio

Introduction

Welcome to my  portfolio! I am WhoisSwitchX, a backend developer with expertise in Java and MySQL. While my primary focus has been on backend technologies, I am currently expanding my skill set to include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository serves as a collection of my projects and learning journey in these new technologies.
